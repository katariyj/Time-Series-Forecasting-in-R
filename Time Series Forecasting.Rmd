This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
class(AirPassengers)
```
Check the data is Stationary or not?

Properties of data to be stationary 
a. Mean is constant.
b. Variance is constant(equi distance from mean).
c. Covariances are same. 
```{r}
plot(AirPassengers)
```
Plot the graph and then mean/ abline
```{r}
plot(AirPassengers)
abline(reg = lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers)))
```
Check the trend Component
```{r}
plot(aggregate(AirPassengers), FUN = mean)
```

```{r}

cycle(AirPassengers)
```
Seasonalty Component
```{r}
boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers))
```
As we can see the data is stationary, therefore we need to do some transformations.
1. Apply log. this helps to sort the second property that is variance is equi distance from the mean

```{r}
plot(log(AirPassengers))

```

2. Use diff. this helps to sort the first property that mean is constant 

```{r}
plot(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```

Model ARIMA - Autoregressive Integration Moving Average
There are values associated with ARIMA
Autoregressive - p
Integration - d
Moving Average - q 

we get these values from acf graph. 

Step1 : check untransformed data

```{r}
acf(AirPassengers)
```
Step 2: Calculate the value of p,d,q

```{r}
acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))

#value of q is 1. As it is inverting after the 1st line. (line starts from zero)

pacf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))

#value of p is 0. As it is inverting after the 0th line. (line starts from zero)

# d value is the number of times we differentiate. therefore, d = 1
```

Step 3 Apply values to ARIMA Model 

```{r}
fit = arima(log(AirPassengers), c(0,1,1), seasonal = list(order = c(0,1,1), period = 12))
```

Predict for next 10 years
```{r}
pred = predict(fit, n.ahead = 10*12)
```
The values are in log form so to convert use 2.718^values

```{r}
pred1 = 2.718^pred$pred

plot(pred1)

```
 
Forecated plot 

```{r}
ts.plot(AirPassengers, pred1, log = 'y', lty = c(1,3))
```
step 5: Test the model 
break the data into train, test and then test the model 
train dataset = 1949 to 1959 
test dataset = 1960

```{r}
df_train = ts(AirPassengers, frequency = 12, start = c(1949,1), end = c(1959, 12))

fit2 = arima(log(df_train), c(0,1,1), seasonal = list(order= c(0,1,1), period = 12))

test_log = predict(fit2, n.ahead = 10*12)

test_values = 2.718^test_log$pred

ts.plot(AirPassengers, test_values, log = "y", lty = c(1,3))
```

Check 1960

```{r}
data_1960 = head(test_values, 12)

data_1960 = round(data_1960, digit=0)

data_1960

original_1960 = tail(AirPassengers, 12)

original_1960


```
